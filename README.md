# predict_attrition_income
Prediction Project with R

## Introduction

The employee attrition rate is an important factor for companies to monitor and manage, as high attrition can lead to significant financial losses and organizational disruption. To better understand the factors that contribute to employee attrition, IBM data scientists have created a fictional dataset that includes various employee attributes such as age, education, job role, monthly income, job satisfaction, and others. This dataset provides an opportunity for machine learning practitioners to develop models that can predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company (binary classification) and estimate their monthly income (regression).

In this project, I plan to develop two separate models to predict attrition and monthly income. I will explore various techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting and evaluate the models' performance using appropriate metrics. My goal is to provide insights into the factors that are most strongly associated with employee attrition and to estimate the typical salary levels of employees based on their individual characteristics and see if they are over or under payed.


### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists. It contains 35 features that provide information about the employees, such as age, gender, education, job role, monthly income, job satisfaction, and performance rating, among others. This dataset is useful for exploring the factors that contribute to employee behavior. The dataset also allows us to explore important questions, such as attrition rates and of monthly incomes based on different categorie such as education, working years, etc.
